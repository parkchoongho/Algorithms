# Sorting Algorithms

### What is Sorting?

Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array) so that the items are in some kind of order.

- Sorting numbers from smallest to largest
- Sorting names alphabetically
- Sorting movies based on release year
- Sorting movies based on revenue

### Why do we need to learn this?

- Sorting is an incredibly common task, so it's good to know how it works
- There are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages

### Objectives

- Implement bubble sort
- Implement selection sort
- Implement insertion sort
- Understand why it is important to learn these simpler sorting algorithms

### Built-In JavaScript Sort Method

- The built-in sort method accepts an optional comparator function

- You can use this comparator function to tell JavaScript how you want it to sort

- The comparator looks at pairs of elements (a and b), determines their sore order based on the return value   

  - If it returns a negative number, a should come before b
  - If it returns a positive number, a should come after b
  - If it returns 0, a and b are the same as far as the sort is concerned
