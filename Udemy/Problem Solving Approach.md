# Problem Solving Approach

### Introduction to Problem Solving

#### Objectives

- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

#### What is an algorithms?

A **process** or **set of steps** to accomplish a certain task

#### How do you improve?

1. **Devise** a plan for solving problems
2. **Mater** common problem solving patterns

#### Problem Solving

1. Understand The Problem
2. Explore Concrete Examples
3. Break It Down
4. Solve / Simplify
5. Look Back and Refactor

### Step 1: Understand The Problem

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
5.  How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

### Step 2: Concrete Examples

Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better

Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should

- Start with Simple Examples
- Progress to More Complex Examples
- Explore Examples with Empty Inputs
- Explore Examples with Invalid Inputs
