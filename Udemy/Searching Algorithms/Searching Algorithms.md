# Searching Algorithms

### Objectives

- Describe what a searching algorithm is
- Implement linear search on arrays
- Implement binary search on sorted arrays
- Implement a naive string searching algorithm
- Implement the KMP string searching algorithm

### How do we search?

Given an array, the simplest way to search for an value is to look at every element in the array and check if it's the value we want.

=> There are many different search methods on arrays in JavaScript:

- indexOf
- includes
- find
- findIndex

But how does these functions work?

### Linear Search Pseudocode

- This function accepts an array and a value
- Loop through the array and check if the current array element is equal to the value
- If it is, return the index at which the element is found
- If the value is never found, return -1

=> Linear Search has **O(n)** Time Complexity

### Binary Search

- Binary Search is a much faster form of search
- Rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time
- Binary Search only works on sorted arrays! 

### Binary Search Pseudocode

- This function accepts a sorted array and a value
- Create a left pointer at the start of the array, and a right pointer at the end of the array
- While the left pointer comes before the right pointer:
  - Create a pointer in the middle
  - If you find the value you want, return the index
  - If the value is too small, move left pointer up
  - If the value is too large, move right pointer down
- If you never find the value, return -1
