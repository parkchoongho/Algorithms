# Binary Search Trees

### Objectives

- Define what a tree is
- Compare and contrast trees and lists
- Explain the differences between trees, binary trees, and binary search trees
- Implement operations on binary search trees

### What is a Tree?

A data structure that consists of nodes in a **parent/child** relationship

#### Lists - linear

#### Trees - nonlinear

A **Singly Linked List** can be a sort of a **special case of a tree**

### Not a Tree

If any nodes are **referencing other nodes that are not below them**, that's not a tree.

And a **Tree** should has **one root!!**

### Tree Terminology

- **Root** - The top node in a tree
- **Child** - A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root
- **Parent** - The converse notion of a child
- **Siblings** - A group of nodes with the same parent
- **Leaf** - A node with no children
- **Edge** - The connection between one node and another

### Real Uses for Trees

- HTML DOM
- Network Routing
- Abstract Syntax Tree
- Artificial Intelligence
- Folders in Operating Systems
- Computer File Systems
