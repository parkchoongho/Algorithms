### Frequency Counters

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values. This can often avoid the need for nested loops or  O(n^2) operations with arrays / strings

**Example**

Write a function called **same**, which accepts two arrays. The function should return true if every value in the array has its corresponding value squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be the same.
