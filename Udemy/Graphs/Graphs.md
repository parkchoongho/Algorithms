# Graphs

### Objectives

- Explain what a graph is
- Compare and contrast different types of graphs and their use cases in the real world
- Implement a graph using an adjacency list
- Traverse through a graph using BFS and DFS
- Compare and contrast graph traversal algorithms

### What are Graphs

A **graph data structure** consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected **graph** or a set of ordered pairs for a directed **graph**. 

#### Graphs = Collections of Nodes + Connections

### Uses for Graphs

- Social Networks
- Location / Mapping
- Routing Algorithms
- Visual Hierarchy
- File System Optimizations
- **EVERYWHERE!**

### Types of Graphs

#### Essential Graph Terms

- **Vertex** - a node
- **Edge** - connection between nodes
- **Weighted / Unweighted** - values assigned to distances between vertices
- **Directed / Undirected** - directions assigned to distances between vertices

### Storing Graphs: Adjacency Matrix

| -     | A     | B     | C     | D     | E     | F     |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A** | 0     | **1** | 0     | 0     | 0     | **1** |
| **B** | **1** | 0     | **1** | 0     | 0     | 0     |
| **C** | 0     | **1** | 0     | **1** | 0     | 0     |
| **D** | 0     | 0     | **1** | 0     | **1** | 0     |
| **E** | 0     | 0     | 0     | **1** | 0     | **1** |
| **F** | **1** | 0     | 0     | 0     | **1** | 0     |
