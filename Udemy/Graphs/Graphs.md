# Graphs

### Objectives

- Explain what a graph is
- Compare and contrast different types of graphs and their use cases in the real world
- Implement a graph using an adjacency list
- Traverse through a graph using BFS and DFS
- Compare and contrast graph traversal algorithms

### What are Graphs

A **graph data structure** consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected **graph** or a set of ordered pairs for a directed **graph**. 

#### Graphs = Collections of Nodes + Connections
