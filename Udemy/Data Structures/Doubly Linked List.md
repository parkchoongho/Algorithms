# Doubly Linked List

### Objectives

- Construct a Doubly Linked List
- Compare and contrast Doubly Linked List and Singly Linked List
- Implement basic operations on a Doubly Linked List

### We know what lists are... but what is doubly?

**Almost** identical to Singly Linked Lists, except every node has another pointer, to the **previous** node!

### Comparisons with Singly Linked Lists

**More Memory === More Flexibility**

=> It's **almost** always a tradeoff!
