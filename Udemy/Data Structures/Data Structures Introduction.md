# Data Structures Introduction

### What Do They Do?

Data Structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

### Why Care?

The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures. You've already worked with many of them unknowingly! 

And of course.... **INTERVIEWS**

There is no **"BEST"** Data Structure. They all excel in different situations. Otherwise why bother learning them all?

Ex) 

Working with map/location data? **Graph**

Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end? **Linked List**

Web scraping nested HTML? **Tree**

Need to write a scheduler? **Binary Heap**

#### There is a tone of contents to take in here.... Don't get overwhelmed trying to master it all at once.
